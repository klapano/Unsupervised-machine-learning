# Unsupervised-machine-learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is not provided with labeled data, but instead must find patterns or relationships in the input data on its own. Some common unsupervised learning algorithms include:

Clustering: group similar data points together
Dimensionality reduction: reduce the number of features in the data while preserving important information
Anomaly detection: identify data points that do not fit with the rest of the dataset.
A simple example of unsupervised learning is k-means algorithm , which is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. The k-means algorithm works by defining spherical clusters, and then finding the center point of each cluster. Each data point is then assigned to the cluster whose center point is closest to it.

It's important to mention that unsupervised learning can be a bit more challenging than supervised learning because there is no clear "correct" output, and the model must find a way to make sense of the data on its own.

I suggest to start with a simple dataset and a well-known algorithm and experiment with different parameters and see how it affects the results. Additionally, you can look at different unsupervised learning algorithms and their use cases to get a better understanding of when they might be appropriate to use.



Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. 

It is used to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data. 
The most common unsupervised learning algorithms are clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Clustering algorithms group similar data points together, for example, grouping customers with similar purchasing habits.

Dimensionality reduction algorithms aim to simplify the data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space, for example, reducing a high-dimensional dataset to two or three dimensions so that it can be visualized.

Some popular unsupervised learning algorithms include:

K-means
Hierarchical Clustering
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Autoencoders
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)


It's important to note that unsupervised learning requires a lot of data and it's hard to evaluate the performance of an unsupervised model.
